# First twitter bot:
The [@BernieSBot](https://twitter.com/BernieSBot) creates different versions of the financial support meme originating from Senator Bernie Sanders.

# Shakespearian Bible Poetry:
The poetry made in `biblepoetry(WIP).py` creates poetry from random words from within the Bible. It is interesting to see how closely resembling the structure of the sentences in the King James translation of the Bible are to the way Shakespeare produced his poetry. The file is still a WIP because the file requires a lot more code to produce legible and poem-worthy iambic pentametric sentences, but for now only produces random poetic words and lines from the Bible itself, no matter the syllable stress.

# Markovism, Making a Markovified Bible:
The python code within `markovbiblenovel.py` takes in a plain text file (.txt) of the King James translation of hte Bible from Project Gutenberg and "markovifies" it. It then takes that markovified Bible and prints it to a very pretty PDF file that includes the markovified Bible verses.
