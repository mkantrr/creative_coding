# First twitter bot:
The [@BernieSBot](https://twitter.com/BernieSBot) creates different versions of the financial support meme originating from Senator Bernie Sanders.

# Shakespearian Bible Poetry:
The poetry made in `biblepoetry(WIP).py` creates poetry from random words from within the Bible. It is interesting to see how closely resembling the structure of the sentences in the King James translation of the Bible are to the way Shakespeare produced his poetry. The file is still a WIP because the file requires a lot more code to produce legible and poem-worthy iambic pentametric sentences, but for now only produces random poetic words and lines from the Bible itself, no matter the syllable stress.

# Markovism, Making a Markovified Bible:
The python code within `markovbiblenovel.py` takes in a plain text file (.txt) of the King James translation of hte Bible from Project Gutenberg and "markovifies" it. It then takes that markovified Bible and prints it to a very pretty PDF file that includes the markovified Bible verses.

# P5.js Screensaver Activity
This activity, written in P5.js javascript, produces an endless image created out of code that emulates code being written like blobs of text. When to go to the next line, what color each blob is, when to indent, when to start a new blob, etc. are all randomized but designedi in a way to emulate what code would generally look like.

# P5.js Clock Activity
This activity, written in P5.js javascript, produces an endless analog style clock that reads the time on the current device the file is being run on. It runs in military time in 24 hours. The hour is represented by the longest line, the minute is represented by the second longest line, the second represented by the third longest line, and millisecond represented by the shortest line that goes the fastest around the center.
